# STEP Discord Bot
A Discord Bot for the Cambridge Sixth Term Examination Paper (STEP)

Created with Python using PostgreSQL (psycopg2)

Emojis will become dysfunctional 5 minutes after the message is sent. This is necessary to make sure the bot is not overwhelmed with data

## Available Commands
* `!s` to retrieve a question e.g. `!s 99 2 3` to get 1999 STEP 2 Q3. You can then mark the question as complete/incomplete by reacting appropriately.
* `!c` to mark a question as complete eg `!c 99 2 3`
* `!uc` to mark a question as incomplete eg `!uc 99 2 3`

**Do not put dashes, letters (e.g. `S2`) or anything else.**
